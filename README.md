#  Smooth Sort
In today's world, developer's use now and then sorting in their mobile applications. For such developer's, Smooth Sort can become a useful package which provides a wonderful flipping animation while sorting a list. Now-a-days, most of the shopping websites reloads the page again for the sorting the list but instead they can provide this animation.

# Algorithm
The algorithm used to build this project is as follows:

I have decided to sort the ListView with single text views by using the default sort method by Dart Language. On clicking the sort button, I would flip each item in the listview and the new updated item will come in its place. 

# Work Done
* I have completed learning the properties of the animated list view in Flutter.

# To-Do
* Implement the flip animation to each listview item.
* Update the listview with the updated sorted items.
